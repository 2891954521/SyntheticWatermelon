/**
 * Represents a broad-phase collision detection algorithm.
 * <p>
 * A {@link BroadphaseDetector} should quickly determine the pairs of objects that possibly intersect.  
 * These algorithms are used to filter out collision pairs in the interest of sending less pairs to 
 * the {@link NarrowphaseDetector} which is generally much more expensive.
 * <p>
 * {@link BroadphaseDetector}s require that the objects are updated via the {@link #update(Object)}
 * method when translated, rotated, or have their shape changed in anyway.
 * <p>
 * A {@link AABBProducer} is used to produce an {@link AABB} from a given object.  AABBs are used by the
 * {@link BroadphaseDetector}s to accelerate the initial detection of collision pairs.
 * <p>
 * Some {@link BroadphaseDetector}s may use a expansion method to expand an object's AABB size.  The 
 * {@link #getAABB(Object)} method returns the expanded {@link AABB} in this scenario.  This expansion 
 * is used to reduce the number of updates to the broad-phase acceleration structure.  See also the
 * {@link AABBExpansionMethod} interface for more detail.
 * <p>
 * The {@link #detect()}, {@link #detect(AABB)}, {@link #raycast(Ray, double)} methods, and their Iterator 
 * counterparts, use the current state of the acceleration structure housed by the {@link BroadphaseDetector}.  
 * Make sure that all changes have been reflected to the broad-phase (via {@link #update(Object)}, 
 * {@link #remove(Object)}, etc) before using these methods.
 * <p>
 * The {@link #detect(Convex, Transform, Convex, Transform)} method does not use the current state of the broad-phase,
 * but the {@link #detect(Object, Object)} does.
 * <p>
 * There are two main operation modes for {@link BroadphaseDetector}s: Full or Incremental. Full is the classic way
 * where every call to the {@link #detect()} or {@link #detectIterator()} methods return all overlapping pairs.  This
 * has the advantage of always getting a fresh list of pairs.  The down side, even with acceleration structures in place,
 * is that it's a lot of extra work, especially for scenes where most objects don't move between frames.  Incremental is
 * the new way where every call to the {@link #detect()} or {@link #detectIterator()} methods returns only the pairs where
 * one of the objects had their AABB updated (see above regarding the expansion method).  In this mode, callers would need
 * to manage the list of pairs overtime and check for those no longer overlapping.  While this is more work on the caller,
 * it's far more efficient.
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> The objects added to a {@link BroadphaseDetector} may be used in data structures that rely on the
 * {@link Object#hashCode()} and {@link Object#equals(Object)} methods and the == operator.  In general, when using subclasses of
 * {@link CollisionBody}, avoid overriding these methods.  When using subclasses of {@link CollisionItem}, avoid
 * reusing those object as the hashcode and equals method depends upon the content.
